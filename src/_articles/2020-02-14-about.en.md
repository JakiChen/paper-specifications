## {{ site.blog.name }} - A simple, free resource for finding the international standards for paper sizes. 
{:.content-heading}

{{ site.blog.name }} was launched in November 2019. It is a research project of designer [Jaki Chen](http://behance.net/jakichen){:target="_blank"} and experience design studio [Helicx,Inc.](#){:target="_blank"}. In order to meet their own business needs and people who need to quickly obtain paper sizes, they jointly created this tool in their spare time.

With a clean and minimal interface, itâ€™s a very usable tool on both desktop computers and mobile devices.

In total, {{ site.blog.name }} lists dimensions of over {{ POSTS.size }} international paper sizes in mm and inches!

The team would love to hear your suggestions for improvement, or any paper sizes they have missed or that you would find useful on the site. Just drop them an email or tweet at them.
